### Build content scripts so that the click of the add contact button will add the active profile to List

### Custom render max-length for each string text so that longer texts will be curtailed & concatenated with "..."

e.g. "Tech Investment Banking Analyst" => "Tech Investment..."

### Modify z-index of header text & favicon logo to prevent users from clicking on & selecting them

This will smoothen out the UX and make it more elegant.

### Conditionally render favicon badge to indicate whether the person is on a LinkedIn profile or not

This will enhance UX-- maybe the favicon shown the logo + green background when they are, and it's logo + gray when they're not (and on default)
